											<h2>C.S. Classes</h2>

											<h3>Current</h3>
										</header>
										<p><strong>Operating Systems</strong> (439) - So far, Dr. Gheith's projects have included implementing cooperative multithreading on a 32-bit system, dealing with concurrency issues between multiple processors (we implemented semaphores using spinlocks for protection, which in turn, used atomic TSL instructions), and implementing a heap along with malloc/free/realloc in C/C++. Our most recent project involved implementing virtual memory using 32-bit paging with 4Kb pages. We also discussed inverted page tables and their uses for 64-bit systems, but did not implement them.</p>
										<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> (343) - Dr. Miikkulainen's first project involved using OpenNERO to write an IDA* search algorithm in python. In one of our other projects, we used Q learning to 'teach' an agent how to find a goal position in a maze. This project had an interesting twist in that it used a tiling method to approximate Q values over an entire region of positions in the maze (as opposed to giving each position its own Q value), thus conserving a significant amount of memory in exchange for an increased constant within the search algorithm's time complexity (we were using k nearest neighbours).</p>

											<h3>Past</h3>

										<p><strong>Computer Architecture</strong> (429) - Assembly is what comes to mind whenever I recall this class. We started off memorizing the functions of each of the x86-64 registers and subsequently started writing programs with them. This class introduced me to GDB, which is not normally very exciting to use when debugging assembly code. However, Prof. Young gave us entertaining projects, such as the Bomb lab, in which we had to find hidden strings or values in the code using GDB to advance to the next phase of the project. We also did a similar lab where we had to 'hack' a vulnerable program. In the process, we learned techniques such as using a buffer overflow to overwrite instructions (code injection), which could be pointing to code that was in the existing program (return-oriented programming). Naturally, we learned quite a bit about computer security through this lab.</p>
										<p><strong>Data Structures</strong> (314) - Apart from simply implementing data structures, Professor Scott made the assignments entertaining by connecting them to real-world applications. We implemented a game of 'impossible' hangman, which kept changing its chosen word every time the user inputted a letter. The word was changed to be the longest (most unique unused characters) word in the remaining dictionary that matched the letters guessed so far. He also had us analyze college football rankings using a graph that we implemented. </p>
										<p><strong>Discrete Math</strong> (429) - One of my favorite subjects is combinatorics, so naturally I enjoyed this class. We learned interesting concepts such as Hamiltonian Circuits, the 4-color Map Theorem, the Master Theorem, etc. Although I often study mathematics on my own time for fun, getting more formal practice in proofs was helpful. I had never previously distinguished between strong and weak induction, but they are certainly used in different ways, as I found out in this course.</p>
