											<h2>C.S. Classes</h2>
										</header>
										<header>
											<h3>Current</h3>
										</header>
										<p><strong>Neural Networks</strong> - So far, we've covered basic principles involving neural nets, such as different loss functions and their pros/cons. We've also implemented simple neural networks for image classification using Torch. </p>
										<p><strong>Quantum Information Science</strong> - This class is being taught by the legendary Scott Aaronson, and is the class I'm most excited about this semester (how often do you get to hear your professor say things like "so the following result was proven by myself and a student a few years ago"?). I've always been curious about physics (specifically, quantum), and mathematically examining quantum computing puts the field in a new light for me. So far, we've covered topics such as distinguishing bases, the Quantum Zeno effect, and density matrices</p>
										<p><strong>Software Engineering</strong> - Most of Professor Downing's projects will involve the same group of ~6 people over the semester working on a full-stack project. As of now, we've gone over CI/CD, Docker, Gitlab, and XP (Extreme Programming). We put these principles to use on our introductory project, which was to code up a Collatz-related algorithm using a Scrum workflow.</p>
										<p><strong>Competitive Programming</strong> - We've covered quite a few interesting applications of common algorithms so far. For example, in competitions, you may have to binary search over the real values to find, perhaps, the smallest value that meets a certain condition.</p>
										<header>
											<h3>Past</h3>

										<p><strong>Data Mining</strong> - The projects in Professor Beasley's class mainly involved building models to classify data points by label, given a set of features. We've implemented decision trees, KNN, and naive Bayesian classifiers (using pandas). We have also done projects involving scikit-learn, which is very helpful for its library functions, such as gridsearch, pipelines, and models. The class projects alternated between implementing common data-mining algorithms from scratch, and then using a library to implement it for us. Our final project involved implementing the relatively recent frequent pattern mining <a href="https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~jpei/publications/sigmod00.pdf">FP-Growth algorithm proposed by Han</a></p>
										<p><strong>Algorithms</strong> - The assignments in this class consist of proving the correctness and runtimes of common algorithms such as MST, Bellman-Ford, Edmonds-Karp, etc. Although most CS students probably already have used these before, formalizing proofs for algorithms has made me look at constructing my algorithms differently as well.</p>
										<p><strong>Operating Systems</strong> (439) - Dr. Gheith's projects included implementing cooperative multithreading on a 32-bit system, dealing with concurrency issues between multiple processors (we implemented semaphores using spinlocks for protection, which in turn, used atomic TSL instructions), and implementing a heap along with malloc/free/realloc in C/C++. Our most recent project involved implementing virtual memory using 32-bit paging with 4Kb pages. We also discussed inverted page tables and their uses for 64-bit systems, but did not implement them. Lastly, we implemented a file system based on ext2 (commonly used by Linux). </p>
										<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> (343) - Dr. Miikkulainen's first project involved using OpenNERO to write an IDA* search algorithm in python. In one of our other projects, we used Q learning to 'teach' an agent how to find a goal position in a maze. This project had an interesting twist in that it used a tiling method to approximate Q values over an entire region of positions in the maze (as opposed to giving each position its own Q value), thus conserving a significant amount of memory in exchange for an increased constant within the search algorithm's time complexity (we were using k nearest neighbours). We later implemented a basic image classification system as well.</p>
										<p><strong>Computer Architecture</strong> (429) - Assembly is what comes to mind whenever I recall this class. We started off memorizing the functions of each of the x86-64 registers, and subsequently started writing programs with them. This class introduced me to GDB, which is not normally very exciting to use when debugging assembly code. However, Prof. Young gave us entertaining projects, such as the Bomb lab, in which we had to find hidden strings or values in the assembly using GDB to advance to each next phase of the project. We also did a similar lab where we had to 'hack' a vulnerable program. In the process, we learned techniques such as using a buffer overflow to overwrite instructions (code injection), which could be pointing to code that was in the existing program (return-oriented programming). Naturally, we learned quite a bit about computer security through this lab.</p>
										<p><strong>Data Structures</strong> (314) - Apart from simply implementing data structures, Professor Scott made the assignments entertaining by connecting them to real-world applications. We implemented a game of 'impossible' hangman, which kept changing its chosen word every time the user inputted a letter. The word was changed to be the longest (most unique unused characters) word in the remaining dictionary that matched the letters guessed so far. He also had us analyze college football rankings using a graph that we implemented. </p>
										<p><strong>Discrete Math</strong> (429) - One of my favorite topics is combinatorics, so naturally I enjoyed this class. We learned interesting concepts such as Hamiltonian Circuits, the 4-color Map Theorem, the Master Theorem, etc. Although I often study mathematics on my own time for fun, getting more formal practice in proofs was helpful. I had never previously distinguished between strong and weak induction, but they are certainly used in different ways, as I found out in this course.</p>
